# CNN Exercise

## Description

Choose an image classification problem that is well-suited to be solved using transfer learning. Choose a suitable pretrained model, re-use the weights of the convolutional layers, and train the dense layers using a series of input images of your own choice. 

Hand in your Jupyter notebook which also functions as a research report. You describe the context of the problem at hand, the methods, the results, and your conclusion. To show progress of training, you should create plots of accuracy and loss versus epoch number. For evaluation, you should construct a confusion matrix and discuss your findings. In addition, you can show some example test images that are classified right and some that are classified wrong. This gives an idea of what your network is capable of (in addition to your confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics).
