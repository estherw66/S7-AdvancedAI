# XAI - Exercise

## Description
Apply Grad-CAM class activation visualisation to the CNN that you have trained before for the CNN exercise. You should apply Grad-CAM to several images from the test set from different classes. Preferably, try some test images that are classified right and some that are classified wrongly by your model. Describe your findings.
